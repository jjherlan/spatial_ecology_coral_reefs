## Saptial pattern of reef-bulding corals

-   Result of positive and negative interactions between neighboring coral that compete for space on the reef to live 

    - Important for ecological theory

- Three-dimensional structure that facilitates abundance and diversity of other reef organisms like fish and crustaceans  

    - Important food sources to island communities

## Saptial pattern of reef-bulding corals

-   Do the frequencies of positive and negative interactions between neighboring coral change over environmental gradients?

    - Important for ecological theory

- Environmental gradients may affect the three-dimensional structure of a reef and may respond in asymmetric ways to acute disturbances.  

    - Important food sources to island communities

## Link between coral interactions and community structure

-   Any ecological consequences of coral interactions must be manifested
